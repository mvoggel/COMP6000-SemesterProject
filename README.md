# COMP6000-SemesterProject


This semester's project for COMP 6000 - Web Development will be centered around a newly created web application to post job listings. 

Title 
CareerConnect: Streamlined Job Discovery and Recruitment

Problem
Job seekers having trouble finding suitable job opportunities. Prospects are continually looking for convenient and easy ways to apply for jobs, without needing to look in several places for all of the information. 

Purpose
The purpose of this application is to bridge the gap between job seekers and employers by providing an easy and intuitive platform for exploring job opportunities and facilitating connections. Our application looks to address the common challenges that are usually associated with the job hunting process, such as filtering through irrelevant listings and the lack of direct engagement with potential employers. We aim to significantly enhance the job hunting experience for both parties involved.

Scope
The scope of the application encompasses a range of functionalities designed to cater to the needs of job seekers and employers alike.

For job seekers, the application will offer a search feature and allows users to filter job listings based on various criteria such as job type, industry, location, and experience. This ensures that users can find positions that closely match their skills and preferences.

For employers, the application will provide a suite of tools to post job openings and interact with potential candidates. This includes the ability to customize job listings with detailed descriptions, requirements, and company information. Employers may also be able to screen applicants through the platform, making the recruitment process more efficient and effective.

The technical architecture of our web application will leverage JSP for the front-end presentation layer, allowing for dynamic content generation based on user interactions and data retrieved from the back-end. Servlets will be used for back-end processing, handling requests and responses between the client and server, as well as implementing business logic. XML will serve as the data storage format for job listings, user profiles and contact information, ensuring that data is structured, easily accessible, and modifiable.

By integrating these technologies, our application seeks to offer a robust, user-friendly platform that streamlines the job search and recruitment process. Through its core functionalities and targeted approach, the application will serve as a valuable resource for job seekers and employers, which could facilitate more meaningful connections and contribute to a more efficient job market.
